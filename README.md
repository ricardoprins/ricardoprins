# How to reach out
No social media for me. Time consuming, boring. Not cool.
That doesn't mean I don't exist. However, time is valuable! 
For this reason, if you think you have a valuable thing that you want to share, or that we need to discuss, feel free to send me an email.

A word of caution, though: I only read emails twice a week, so don't feel bad if you don't get any response. I normally won't, unless it's something interesting, or cool.
