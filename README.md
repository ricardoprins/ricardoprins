# Hello World!


This is not a decent README.md file...but it will be, soon enough!

For now:

* Visit Tesseract Coding's [NeoAlgo](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo) repository and contribute!
* Take your vitamins and keep swimming!
* Stay away from NSFW stuff and from everything that isn't healthy XD
* Comment your code - it makes a lot easier for people to understand what you've done wrong hahaha

#### I LOVE YOU ALL! LOVE IS ALL WE NEED
_(and also bacon...)_
